Data science utilizes statistics to inform/create analytics, inference, or intelligence for business outcomes, incorporating engineering, programming, and statistical methods to understand and recognize patterns.\nThere are also some very key differences/similarities between data science and statistics. These include:\n\nData Dependency: At times, data science may require adjustments or curation of data, while some statistical analysis could simulate data.\nReliance on Probability Theory: Both rely heavily on probability theory to solve complex problems. There are variations to this usage, but probability theory remains a large pillar of both.\nData Cleanliness: There are some key differences between data quality and cleaning in DS and statistics. A statistical study may require cleaner data, given that some DS roles require data engineering and database work.\nDifferences in Programming Languages: Typically, there are expectations for data scientists to have control over more programming languages than statisticians. Again, there are many instances where statisticians would code in many of the languages that a data scientist would. However, in DS work, there may be more front-end work required that enable the insights created into tools for leadership.\n\nAfter working 10 years in various roles, I sit between both sides of data science and statistics. I understand the raw data from a data science/engineering perspective. However, there are also key aspects such as analytics, intelligence, and more applied decision science problems that show my exposure to Data Science. In addition, I use statistical theories often to bridge the gap between models and risk management for more statistical usage in my work."
